rastools (0.2-1~ppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * New reset-zoom action is slightly more intuitive than the old reset-crop
    action
  * New rasdump utility permits easy conversion between different data
    formats, including the .RAS and .dat formats as well as CSV and Excel
  * Fixed bug in .dat parsing: the system on longer assumes that abscissa and
    ordinate lists are sorted (.dat parser is also a bit faster)
  * The rasviewer application now correctly displays progress while performing
    long loads
