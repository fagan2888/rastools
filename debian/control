Description: Tools for converting scans from the SSRL to images.
 rastools is a small suite of utilities for converting data files obtained from
 SSRL (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource) scans (.RAS and .DAT files)
 into images. Various simple manipulations (cropping, percentiles, histograms,
 color-maps) are supported. Most tools are command line based, but a Qt-based
 GUI is also included.
