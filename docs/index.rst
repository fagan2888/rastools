Welcome!

`RasTools`_ is a small suite of utilities for converting data files obtained
from `Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource`_ (SSRL) scans (.RAS and .DAT
files) into images. Various simple manipulations (cropping, percentiles,
histograms, color-maps) are supported. Most tools are command line based, but a
Qt-based GUI is also included which incorporates the functionality of the
command line tools for convenience.
