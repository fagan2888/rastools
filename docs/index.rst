rastools is a small suite of utilities for converting data files obtained from
SSRL (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource) scans (.RAS and .DAT files)
into images. Various simple manipulations (cropping, percentiles, histograms,
color-maps) are supported. Most tools are command line based, but a Qt-based
GUI is also included.
