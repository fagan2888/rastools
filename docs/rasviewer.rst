rasviewer
=========

This is the GUI portion of the rastools suite. It can open multiple data files
simultaneously, displaying one channel of data from each at a time, export images
of those channels and perform all the manipulations that :program:`rasextract` is
capable of.

rasviewer has no (special) command line options beyond those of any ordinary
X11 application and is usually invoked from the start menu of whatever platform
it is installed upon.
